# Neuroxide

Welcome! This project is an attempt to rewrite the PyTorch framework (maintaining a consistent API call) in Rust in hopes of a faster, hard-typed AI framework. This project is currently in its Alpha phase so feel free to contribute or reach out at my [email](kshahusa@gmail.com)! As this project is in its early phases, documentation will be sparse but a quick overview of the development scope will be provided below.

## In Progress
* Unary operations
* Testing coverage
* Benchmarking
* CUDA support
* Matrix Multiplications
